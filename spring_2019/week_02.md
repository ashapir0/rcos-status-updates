## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I started our repository and git organization. I also began working with Lerna.js but ran into
some issues regarding TypeScript integration.  It seems inhereting tsconfig.json files might be a bit tricky.
I might have to revisit that later. 

## This Week's Plan

For now, Josh and I will be working in an experimental repository before implementing the final version.
We are also trying to decide on an underlying Node serial-communication library. I am leaning towards SerialPort.

## Anything Blocking?

Still waiting for Josh to get documentation from the company.
