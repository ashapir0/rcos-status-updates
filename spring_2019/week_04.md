## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I started implementing rudimentary commands, but I am running into issues with control-flow.
In essence, the device streams data out until it transmits a terminating character.

I'd like for the end implementation to have a linear control flow, however lining that up with event-emitters
may prove to be more challenging than I initially thought. 

## This Week's Plan

This week is going to be spring break, I don't anticipate getting much done since I will be traveling abroad.
