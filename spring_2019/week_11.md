## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I produced a frontend demonstration showing how our library can easily be hooked into other applications.
I did this over socket.io which was fairly easy, however parsing out the data proved more challenging.

## This Week's Plan

This week I'll be wrapping up our project! Thank you RCOS!
