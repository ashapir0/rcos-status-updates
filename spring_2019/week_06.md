## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I worked with Josh to try and integrate his Python-based checksum logic into our end
device-controller.  It seems that his implementation was not thorough since he only ensured the connection
itself was valid and not the commands. We're going to have to regroup to figure this out.

## This Week's Plan

This week I'd like to evaluate different approaches to solving this checksum algorithm trouble.
I'd also like to eventually start implementing other commands.

## Anything Blocking?
