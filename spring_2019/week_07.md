## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week Josh and I were able to fix his checksum logic and we've started porting it to Node.

## This Week's Plan

This week I want to fix our Lerna repository, it seems like I might have to delete it from github.
I also want to start setting up CI/CD.

## Anything Blocking?

Lerna TypeScript inheritence.
