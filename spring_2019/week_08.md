## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I got our Lerna.js monorepo setup, however I couldn't get CI working. I might try TravisCI & Code Climate.
I also helped Josh port over more code, however there seems to be some discrepencies with how binary data is handled.

## This Week's Plan

This week I want to get unit testing and CI setup, and continue to help Josh with Node.js byte implementations.
