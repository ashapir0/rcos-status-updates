## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week Josh and I sat down and started working on scoping out the project, coming up with names, etc.
We've decided to use Whistler brand radios for RCOS this semester.

## This Week's Plan

This week I'd like to start structuring our main repository and implementing the packages in our mono-repo.
Using Lerna.js will allow us to have a centralized and synchronized device-controller interface.

## Anything Blocking?

Waiting for Josh to get documentation from the company.
