## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I finished most of the frontend boilerplate but decided to use MobX instead of Redux.

While MobX is more implicit than Redux and therefore less predictable I think the simplicity will aid other team members who are less familiar with the stack.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I'd like to start getting team members acclimated to our stack and make some progress on the backend setting up Express in a modular way.
Further I'd like to start database migrations.
