## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I began implementing some of the boilerplate necessary for the frontend and backend (client and service).
This involved initializing repositories and working through some Web-Pack.

## This Week's Plan

This coming week I'd like to progress more on frontend boilerplate with React/Redux and a router.
