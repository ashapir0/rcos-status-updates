## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I implemented the Appeals Screen for the judicial board members with special cases for non-reviewing users (Parking Office Officials).
I also taught other team members how to write unit/integration tests.

## This Week's Plan

This week I am going to document and test the logical-cas-client, and hopefully add CI/CD.
I will also start writing some frontend example tests.
