## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I wrote my own CAS client called logical-cas-client that is very robust and modular. I also integrated it with our backend.
I added several protection layers including CORS and XSRF.

## This Week's Plan

This week I'd like to start implementing the frontend.
